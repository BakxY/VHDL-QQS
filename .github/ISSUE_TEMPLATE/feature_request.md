# Feature Request

**Describe the Feature**

A clear and concise description of the feature you'd like to see. *(Be specific. Instead of "Add a new tool," say "Add a VHDL code coverage visualization tool.")*

**Motivation**

Why do you want this feature? What problem does it solve or what benefit does it provide? *(Be specific. Instead of "It would be nice," say "This feature would allow users to easily identify untested code paths, improving the quality and reliability of their designs.")*

**Suggested Implementation**

How could this feature be implemented? Be as specific as possible. *(For example, "Integrate with QuestaSim to generate code coverage data and display it as an overlay on the VHDL source code in VS Code.")*

**Possible Use Cases**

Provide examples of how this feature would be used and who would benefit from it. *(For example, "This feature would be used by verification engineers during the simulation and testing phase. It would help them ensure comprehensive test coverage and identify areas for improvement.")*

**Screenshots/Mockups (Optional)**

If applicable, add screenshots or mockups to help visualize the feature. *(Annotate screenshots or create mockups to clearly show the proposed feature.)*

**Additional context**

Add any other context about the feature here. *(This is important! Include things like:)*

* Are there any similar features in other extensions or tools?
* Do you have any specific preferences or requirements for the implementation?
* Are there any potential drawbacks or limitations to consider?
* Any relevant configuration details or workflows.
