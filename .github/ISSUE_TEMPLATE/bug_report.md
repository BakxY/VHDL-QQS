**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1.  Go to '...' *(Be precise.  Instead of "Go to the project," say "Open the `my_project` folder in VS Code.")*
2.  Click on '....' *(Be specific.  Instead of "Click the button," say "Click the 'Compile Project' button in the status bar.")*
3.  Scroll down to '....' *(If scrolling is involved, explain what to scroll to. For example, "Scroll down to the 'Files' section in the Explorer view.")*
4.  See error *(Describe the error.  Is it a message? Where does it appear?  What does it say?)*

**Expected behavior**

A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. *(Be specific. Instead of "The project should compile," say "The project should compile without errors, and a `.sof` file should be generated in the `output` directory.")*

**Screenshots**

If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.  *(Annotate screenshots to highlight the relevant parts.)*

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**

*   OS: \[e.g. Windows 10, macOS Ventura, Ubuntu 22.04]
*   VS Code version: \[e.g. 1.97.2]
*   Extension version: \[e.g. 1.4.1]
*   Quartus version: \[e.g. 23.1std]
*   Questa version: \[e.g. 23.1pro]

**Additional context**

Add any other context about the problem here.  *(This is important!  Include things like:)*

*   Are there any specific settings you are using in the extension or in Quartus/Questa?
*   Does the bug always occur or only sometimes?  If sometimes, under what circumstances?
*   Are there any error messages in the VS Code developer console (Help > Toggle Developer Tools)?  If so, please include them.
*   Are there any relevant log files or output from Quartus/Questa?
*   If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (a small project that demonstrates the bug).  This is the best way to help developers understand and fix the problem.
