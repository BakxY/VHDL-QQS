# Quality of Life Improvement Request

**Describe the Quality of Life Improvement**

A clear and concise description of the improvement you'd like to see. *(Be specific. Instead of "Make it better," say "Add a setting to automatically format VHDL files on save.")*

**Motivation**

Why do you want this improvement? What problem does it solve or what benefit does it provide? *(Be specific. Instead of "It's annoying," say "Currently, I have to manually format my VHDL files, which slows down my workflow and introduces inconsistencies.")*

**Suggested Implementation**

How could this improvement be implemented? Be as specific as possible. *(For example, "Add a checkbox in the extension settings labeled 'Format VHDL on Save'. When checked, the extension should run the configured VHDL formatter automatically when a VHDL file is saved.")*

**Possible Use Cases**

Provide examples of how this improvement would be used and who would benefit from it. *(For example, "This would benefit all users who work with VHDL and prefer consistent formatting. It would save time and reduce the risk of formatting errors.")*

**Screenshots/Mockups (Optional)**

If applicable, add screenshots or mockups to help visualize the improvement. *(Annotate screenshots or create mockups to clearly show the proposed changes.)*

**Additional context**

Add any other context about the improvement here. *(This is important! Include things like:)*

* Are there any similar features in other extensions or tools?
