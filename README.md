# VHDL-QQS (VHDL-Quartus Questa Simulate)

This project aims to automate the creation of test benches and support files for FPGA designs created using Quartus from Intel. By integrating a custom extension into VS Code, users can efficiently set up simulation environments with minimal manual effort.
