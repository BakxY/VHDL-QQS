## Introduction

Working with Intel FPGAs using the Quartus development environment can be a real hassle.  Quartus lacks several key features that modern developers expect, making the development process more tedious than it needs to be.  It doesn't offer any code completion, which slows down coding and increases the risk of errors.  The absence of a code formatter makes it difficult to maintain a consistent and readable codebase, especially in larger projects. And perhaps most importantly, for those late-night debugging sessions, Quartus lacks a dark modeâ€”a feature many consider essential for comfortable work.

During my studies, I took a course on FPGAs that heavily relied on Intel Quartus.  After struggling with the software suite for a semester, I reached my breaking point.  I realized there had to be a better way, so I began developing this extension.  My goal was to create a tool that would allow students (and anyone working with Intel FPGAs) to compile, program, and generate testbenches for use in QuestaSim, all without having to use Quartus as their primary text editor.  This extension aims to streamline the FPGA development workflow and provide a more modern and user-friendly experience.  It addresses the shortcomings of Quartus by offering a more feature-rich environment.  Take a look at the features section later in this documentation to see how this extension can improve your FPGA development process.
